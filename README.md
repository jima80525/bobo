# Bookdog
Simple book database tracker.  Currently being rewritten to use QT

## TODO

* manage date field in db correctly
* filters (but maybe not as important with the sorted view?)
* convert json format to db
* edit date in table?
* do I want menus instead of button? in addition to?
* backup db before write (or on startup?)
*
